LOW-KEY BUGS
============
#64 Add automated tests in my Makefiles to detect untranslated strings.
#47 0x0019 unicode char makes the innerHTML insertion phase fail
#7 Make everything asynchronous. Start filling in messages for the first
  query, then launch the extended query that fetches more messages, and then
  asynchronously insert those in the right place as they arrive (i.e.
  onItemsAdded, not onQueryCompleted). There's already that kind of logic in
  selectionsummaries.js and we're currently duplicating it, so maybe check with
  davida or asuth if I can refactor selectionsummaries.js to suit my needs.

BUGS DUE TO THUNDERBIRD
=======================
#?? Sent messages do not appear in conversations until you open the "Sent"
  folder yourself. Bug 534449.
#29 Encoding issues (Chinese not ok, Czech not ok either, French not ok either).
  Especially the dates. We'll that's a Thunderbird issue (a
  XPConnect/storage-related one) that will hopefully be fixed in the next
  release. See bug 547088.
#12 Extension does not work with newsgroups (see bug 478167) and possibly other
types of accounts.
#?? Dates are incorrectly translated (some are, some are not) see bug 537401
#?? Nasty flickering when scrolling messages with HTML display on. See
  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=540911
#21 Some conversations are erroneously recognized as multiple conversations
  (esp. when you change addresses when replying).
  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=538750, partly fixed by the
  extension, Thunderbird patch pending.
